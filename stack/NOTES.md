Bear in mind that while the subject says:
```
- pop(stack) : Remove the top item from the stack and return it.
  If the stack is empty, the function returns NULL.

- peek(stack) : Return the top of the stack.
  If the stack is empty, the function returns NULL.
```
It doesn't really mean "return the node." It means "return the node's _contents_."
